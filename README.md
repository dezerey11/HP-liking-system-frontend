# Liking System

## Project Summary

This project displays a roster page of characters from the Harry Potter films and their data. The user will be able to see how many people have "Liked" their favorite characters. If the user is logged in, they will have the ability to like and add themselves to that characters number of likes using the thumbs up voting widget. The button will disappear after the user clicks on "Like". To account for the dynamic API, the backend will search for any changes every 15 minutes.
